# COMP110 Worksheet 3: Flowcharts and pseudocode

This is the base repository for COMP110 Worksheet 3.

Fork this repository, and edit `README.md` to show your pseudocode solving the worksheet task. Tip: use triple backticks to preserve spacing, e.g.:

```
User interacts with terminal
User selects a value for letterAmount and a value for maxTries
10 words with letterAmount amount of letters are displayed in a list
Loop until game ends:
   User selects a word
   Terminal displays "x correct letters"
   IF all letters correct:
      User wins
      END
   ELIF NOT all letters correct AND User still has a try left:
      User's next choice is between words that have x letters in the same place as their previous guess
   ELSE:
      User loses
      END
```
